Robot Pancake Chef

Description:
The Robot Chef is a robot that can cook and plate meals using an expandable, user-input menu. For our project, we will teach it how to make pancakes using the UR3 to grab ingredients and cooking utensils, and a new robot that will dispense liquid ingredients including pancake batter and syrup. It is intended to be used in a commercial or home kitchen, where the user can select and customise their meal via a touchscreen interface. With the potential for versatility beyond pancakes and a capability for storage, both robots will travel on linear rails to assist the kitchen process. 

New Industrial Robot:
The new robot will be a 3-link arm, with a nozzle for an end-effector with the purpose to dispense different liquid ingredients. These ingredients will be connected via tubing to various bottles allowing the robot to coordinate between them. The arm will be mounted on a linear rail, allowing translation along the countertop including towards a stove or to be stored away. Dynamically, the robot will have 3 DOF, providing rotation in x, y & z axes. Supplementing this movement, links 1 and 2 will be approximately 300 mm and link 3 closest to the nozzle is estimated at 150 mm. 

Chosen New Robot: IRB 910SC SCARA
